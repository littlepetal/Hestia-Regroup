# Hestia Bushfire Control Bot
This program simulates the high level functionalities of a bushfire manager bot. 
The bot can perform controlled burning and fire elimination.
It is intended that this program is extended to include the use of OpenCV and ROS nodes to implement the simulations on the physical turtlebot.
